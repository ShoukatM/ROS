# 1. Creating a workspace for catkin
mkdir -p catkin_ws/src && cd catkin_ws
catkin_make

# 2. Creating a ROS Package
$cd catkin_ws/src
$catkin_create_pkg <package_name> std_msgs rospy roscpp
# switch back to catkin_ws, source the generated setup file to add the workspace to your ROS environment
$cd .. && . devel/setup.bash

# 3. Create a publisher
roscd <package_name>
mkdir scripts && cd scripts
wget https://raw.github.com/ros/ros_tutorials/kinetic-devel/rospy_tutorials/001_talker_listener/talker.py && chmod +x talker.py

# Modify talker.py according your needs.. (it's a vim-like editor I guess) 
rosed <package_name> talker.py

# Building the nodes
cd catkin_ws
catkin_make

# Running the nodes with rescore or runtime manager running in another terminal
rescore
**OR**
roslaunch runtime_manager runtime_manager.launch

# Back to the 1st terminal, run the talker node
rosrun <package_name> talker.py
